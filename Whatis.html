			<h1>What are security tests?</h1><br>

			<p>Security testing is the type of software testing where we focus on finding the vulnerabilities of Systems, Protocols, Databases, File Paths, etc. With this type of testing we take care of finding the risks, these security tests can be done through
				 tools such as security applications.
			</p>
			<p>Let's remember that a <b>vulnerability</b> is any error or weakness in the system's security procedures, design, implementation or any internal control that could lead to a violation of the system's security policy.

			<h2>Purpose of security tests</h2>
			<p>The main goal of Security Testing is to identify threats in the system and measure potential vulnerabilities, so that threats can be detected and the system does not stop working or cannot be exploited. It also helps to detect all the possible security risks in the system and helps the developers to fix the problems by coding.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Types of security tests</h2>
			<p><b>Vulnerability Scanning:</b> This is done through automated software to scan a system against signatures of known vulnerabilities.</p>
            <p><b>Security scanning:</b> Involves identifying network and system vulnerabilities, which in turn provides solutions to reduce these risks. This scanning can be done for manual and automatic scanning.</p>
            <p><b>Penetration test:</b> This type of test simulates an attack by a malicious hacker. This test involves scanning a particular system to check for possible vulnerabilities from an external hacking attempt.</p>
            <p><b>Risk Assessment:</b> This test includes an analysis of security risks observed in the organization. The risks are classified as Low, Medium and High. This test recommends controls and measures to reduce risk.</p>
            <p><b>Security Audit:</b> This is an internal audit of the application and operating systems to detect security flaws. An audit can also be performed through an online audit of the code.</p>
            <p><b>Ethical support:</b> You are hacking organizational software systems. Unlike malicious hackers, who steal for their own profit, the secret is to expose security flaws in the system.</p>
            <p><b>Posture Assessment:</b> This combines security scanning, Ethical Support, and risk assessments to demonstrate an organization's overall security posture.</p>
			
			<h2><b>*Important*</b></h2>
			<p><b>Remember</b> penetration testing and vulnerability assessment are not the same.<br>

				Penetration tests are not the same as vulnerability assessments, which provide a prioritized list of security weaknesses and how to fix them, but they are often done together. Penetration tests are often done with a particular goal in mind. These goals generally fall under one of the following three objectives:<br>
				
				identify hackable systems, 
				try to hack a specific system, 
				carry out a data breach</p>
